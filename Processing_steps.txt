PCA
- Min-max scaling is used, because standard scaling shows too much difference
in variances
- Determine the principal components (PC) and the explained variances (EV)
    - Since the purpose of the assignment is to predict, a high EV is needed
    (than when only analyzing data)
    - 85% EV will be used (this is a general value for machine learning
    purposes)
- From the first X PCs, per descriptors the sum of their loading values will be
calculated to determine the overall importance of the specific descriptor.
    - By computing the sum of the loading values of a specific descriptor, the
    loading values will be weighed with the EV of the PC they belong to, since
    higher loading values with the first PC is more favorable than a higher
    loading of a lower PC.
